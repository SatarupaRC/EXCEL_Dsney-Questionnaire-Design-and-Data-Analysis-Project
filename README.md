# Disney+ Questionnaire Design and Data Analysis

## Background Information 

Company Background: Disney+ is a streaming service produced by the Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution unit of the Walt Disney Company. It was launched on November 12, 2019. It started as a domestic service in the United States, and then expanded internationally after Fall 2019. The service is the exclusive home to Disney-owned original content from Disney, Pixar, Marvel Entertainment, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, and National Geographic channels. Internationally, Star is available, which carries mature content for the service.

## Business Opportunity

Cord-cutting is not a new trend, however, Covid-19 has accelerated the adoption of cutting pay TV and moving towards streaming options. This trend will only continue to rise in the coming years and streaming companies like Disney+ need to be ready to capture this new set of customers.

The data in the chart indicates cord-cutting will continue to rise, the percentage change from 2019 to the expected volume in 2024 is expected to be ~89%. Currently Disney+ faces competition from Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, ESPN+, and HBO Max to name a few. It is expected that new players will join the “streaming wars” in the coming years and make an already crowded field even more so.

## Translating the management opportunity into research objectives 

The business opportunity is not in itself an environmental issue, however the environment of Covid-19 has accelerated the opportunity for continued growth. The management opportunity lays with the Strategy that Disney+ will implement to gain market share and/or retain its current subscribers. The two most important factors that we believe will help Disney+ achieve this are pricing and segmentation/targeting. The use of streaming will continue to grow. It is important that Disney+ targets the right audience to help it grow its subscriber base and that its pricing is competitive among its competitors. As cord-cutting becomes more prevalent it will be interesting to see how consumers react to the multitude of options and how company’s price and message play a role in which streaming service is chosen. How Disney+ positions itself and attracts new customers will determine whether they gain or lose market share as it currently ranks 3rd amongst its competitors. Disney+ and its parent company have a wealth of information on their customer base at their disposal. Now is the time to drill down into its customer base and use that information to identify key attributes that can be used to target future subscribers and also develop retention strategies.

## Marketing research objectives

The objective of our marketing research is to identify who Disney+ should target with their marketing campaigns. Audience targeting is important because it will lead to more precise marketing campaigns and will lead to less waste of dollars because it will help reach the audience who will most likely be in-market or will purchase a Disney+ subscription. The other advantage of knowing key attributes of Disney+ consumers allows us to build out Lookalike (LAL) audience segments. These types of segments help us reach an audience that looks just like existing customers. With these segments, we can expand our targeting reach with marketing campaigns and reach new potential consumers.

Conversely, our research will also give us a look at the attributes of consumers who do not have a Disney+ subscription. Knowing what this audience looks like will help us in developing a personalized conquesting strategy with our marketing campaign. 

The research will provide Disney+ with new ideas and function for-suggestion. Through comprehensive research we can analyze the situation and marketing problem that Disney+ may be facing. The research information we will be collecting is going to help guide a new marketing strategy for the services provided. How can Disney+ improve their customer services and bundle services. Looking for ways to improve their sales strategies and gain new members. 

## Methods

The sampling frame consists of people who fit our target population. The criteria used to develop the sample frame are those who have: 
-	Disney+ subscription.  
-	Subscription to any of the following streaming services: HBO, Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon, as these are the other streaming services with high market shares.  
-	Stream on multiple platforms like: Smart TV, Mobile, Tablet, Laptop, Gaming console.

For our sampling strategy, we chose convenience sampling because it is an easier and inexpensive way to obtain our data and find people who had multiple streaming platforms and would be willing to share their experiences and critiques with us. This type of sample is going to be a nonprobability sample though, so there will be no possibility of detecting any error because we will not be collecting the data in a truly random manner. 

Due to Covid-19 restrictions we used internet surveys as our collection method. Some advantages of online data collection are that the respondents will be able to complete the survey when it is convenient for them. Also, internet surveys have a high rate of response, and it is easier to reach a diverse audience. Furthermore, it will be relatively inexpensive, and the survey can be completed quickly. 

In the survey, the respondents are first presented with three filter questions, which are the criteria for our sample frame. We used these questions during data analysis to select respondents that qualified our sample frame criteria.
